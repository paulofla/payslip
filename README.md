monthlyPayslip is an easy way to calculate an employee's monthly payslip.

## My Assumptions

* Exceptions can be thrown
* Only one month will be inputted
* Only one row will be inputted at a time
* No Front-end
* Rounded amounts are for calculations and not on inputs
* Continuous Integration wasn't setup
