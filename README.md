monthlyPayslip is an easy way to calculate an employee's monthly payslip.

## My Assumptions
  •     Exceptions can be thrown
  •     Only one month will be inputted
  •     Only one row will be inputted at a time
  •     No Front-end
  •     Rounded amounts are for calculations and not on inputs
  •     Continuous Integration wasn't setup
